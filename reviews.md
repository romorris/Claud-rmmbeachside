    <p>"This is a great place. Very clean, great having a 1 1/2 baths. Kitchen had everything you need for cooking. Great screened patio overlooking shallow waterway, saw egrets, ducks, and a heron while there. Michelle was very accommodating... Highly recommend her as a host."</p>

    <p>"Great place to stay! The unit was very clean, bright and had every amenity needed. Michelle provided great beach chairs and a nice beach umbrella. Great location just a block from the beach and many restaurants. We’ll be returning for sure!"</p>

    <p>"Amazing stay! The unit was beautiful and we had every amenity. Michelle is very detail oriented and everything was at our fingertips. The walks to the beach were beautiful and less than 5 minutes. Bed super comfy."</p>

    <p>"When we arrived, Michelle was waiting for us and even helped us carrying in our boxes. Our screened in patio was lovely with 2 rocking chairs. Michelle even bought a toy for my dog. Willie, our dog, could dine out with us. Jupiter is a very dog-friendly town."</p>

    <p>"Everything was as she described, the pool was in front of the condo and the parking space is at your front door. The best part is walking only 800 steps to the beautiful beach and relaxing in the provided beach chairs! Thank you Michelle!"</p>

    <p>"Michelle’s place was very comfortable, clean, quiet, and fitted out with everything we could need. Short walk to the beach. No question we would stay there again."</p>
